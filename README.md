# CS113-GP0-UML
## GP #0 for CS113 - Javadoc

>The goal of this project is to 1) write Javadoc for a method and 2) practice advanced GitHub operations like branches, pull requests, merging, etc.

### Project Deliverables:
- Partner A create a branch with your name and...
    - Write a Javadoc comment for the ```compareTo(Person per)``` method of a class Person. Assume that class ```Person``` has two String data fields ```lastName``` and ```firstName``` with the obvious meanings. Provide preconditions and postconditions if needed.
    - Create a detailed Sequence diagram on cloning a GitHub repository and setting the project up in IntelliJ with a gradle file (see GitHub Setup + Assignment Clone guide, as well as Introduction-to-CI and project setup).
    - Open a pull request for Partner B to review and merge.
- Partner B create a branch with your name and...
    - Write a Javadoc comment for the ```changelastName(boolean justMarried, String newlast)```  method of class ```Person```. Provide preconditions and postconditions if needed.
    - Open a pull request for Partner B to review and merge.

### Steps to be completed by each partner in the team:
- Step 1:
    - Complete your own branch + diagrams, open pull request
- Step 2:
    - Look at your partners branch/pull request, provide constructive feedback (catch any typos, missing methods, missing notation, suggestions for improvements, etc.)
    - Make any changes to your respective branches
- Before "turning in":
    - Merge both branches to the `master` branch
